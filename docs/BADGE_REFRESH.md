# Badge Refresh Note

## "Package Not Found" on Badges?

If you see "PACKAGE NOT FOUND" on the shields.io badges, don't worry! This is normal for newly published packages.

### Why This Happens

- **Shields.io** caches badge data for performance
- New packages take **2-6 hours** to appear in their cache
- Your package **IS** live on PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/pngmeta/

### Timeline

| Time After Publish | Status |
|-------------------|---------|
| 0-2 hours | Badges may show "Not Found" |
| 2-6 hours | Badges update automatically |
| 24 hours | Download stats become available |

### Manual Refresh

If badges still show issues after 6 hours:

1. **Clear shields.io cache:**
   ```
   Visit: https://shields.io/badges/py-pi-version
   Click "Refresh Badge"
   ```

2. **Force browser refresh:**
   - Chrome/Firefox: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
   - This clears your browser cache

3. **Verify package exists:**
   ```bash
   pip search pngmeta
   # or visit directly:
   # https://pypi.org/project/pngmeta/
   ```

### Current Status (Oct 5, 2025)

✅ Package published to PyPI  
✅ Package page live: https://pypi.org/project/pngmeta/  
⏳ Badges updating (2-6 hours)  
⏳ Download stats (available tomorrow)

### What Works Now

Even while badges update:
- ✅ `pip install pngmeta` works perfectly
- ✅ Package appears in PyPI search
- ✅ All documentation links work
- ✅ GitHub repo is accessible

The badges are just cosmetic and will auto-update!
